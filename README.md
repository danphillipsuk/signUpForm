# signUpForm
A simple sign up form assigned as a part of the intermediate HTML and CSS module in The Odin Project.

The goal of this project was simply to translate a design of a generic sign up page, provided by the course (below), and use the built in HTML form validation functions to ensure correct data is collected/passed.

I also coded a very simple Javascript function to check that the submitted passwords are a match - removing the ability to submit the form if the passwords do not match by changing the display status of the submit button.
